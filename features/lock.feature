Feature: Locking Teams
  As an admin
  I want for a series of checks to be implemented
  so that training teams cannot pick their roster until all project teams are locked in.

Background:
  
  
@wip
Scenario: Training team cannot pick until after project team does

@wip
Scenario: Training team locks in after project team
  
@wip
Scenario: Training team should not lock in before project team (sad path)
  
@wip
Scenario: Training team should not lock in more than X number of dancers

@wip
Scenario: Current user is not the director of team he/she is trying to lock

@wip
Scenario: Final randomization after all training teams are locked in and no conflicts exist
